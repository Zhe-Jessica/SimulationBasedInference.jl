When used for data assimilation, this algorithm is also known as the \"particle batch smoother\". This implementation is adapted from the python implementation by Kristoffer Aalstad:\n\nhttps://github.com/ealonsogzl/MuSA/blob/0c02b8dc25a0f902bf63099de68174f4738705f0/modules/filters.py#L169\n\nOriginal docstring:\n\nInputs:     obs: Observation vector (m x 1 array)     pred: Predicted observation ensemble matrix (m x N array)     R: Observation error covariance 'matrix' (m x 1 array, or scalar) Outputs:     w: Posterior weights (N x 1 array)     Neff: Effective sample size Dimensions:     N is the number of ensemble members and m is the number     of observations.\n\nHere we have implemented the particle batch smoother, which is a batch-smoother version of the particle filter (i.e. a particle filter without resampling), described in Margulis et al. (2015, doi: 10.1175/JHM-D-14-0177.1). As such, this routine can also be used for particle filtering with sequential data assimilation. This scheme is obtained by using a particle (mixture of Dirac delta functions) representation of the prior and applying this directly to Bayes theorem. In other words, it is just an application of importance sampling with the prior as the proposal density (importance distribution). It is also the same as the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) technique (with a formal Gaussian likelihood)which is widely used in hydrology.\n\nThis particular scheme assumes that the observation errors are additive Gaussian white noise (uncorrelated in time and space). The \"logsumexp\" trick is used to deal with potential numerical issues with floating point operations that occur when dealing with ratios of likelihoods that vary by many orders of magnitude.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#SimulationBasedInference.loglikelihood-Tuple{SimulatorLikelihood, Vararg{Any}}","page":"API Reference","title":"SimulationBasedInference.loglikelihood","text":"loglikelihood(lik::SimulatorLikelihood, args...)\n\nEvaluates the log-lielihood of lik on the current observable state by constructing the predictive_distribution and evaluating the logpdf of the data.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#SimulationBasedInference.logprob-Tuple{UnivariateDistribution, Number}","page":"API Reference","title":"SimulationBasedInference.logprob","text":"logprob(d::UnivariateDistribution, x::Number)\n\nAlias for logpdf(d,x) on Distribution types.\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#SimulationBasedInference.obscov-Tuple{AbstractMatrix}","page":"API Reference","title":"SimulationBasedInference.obscov","text":"obscov(::AbstractMatrix)\nobscov(::AbstractVector)\nobscov(::Number)\n\nBuilds a standard form multivariate normal covariance matrix from the given matrix, vector (diagonal), or scalar (isotropic).\n\n\n\n\n\n","category":"method"},{"location":"api/#SimulationBasedInference.obscov-Tuple{Vararg{SimulatorLikelihood}}","page":"API Reference","title":"SimulationBasedInference.obscov","text":"obscov(likelihoods::SimulatorLikelihood...)\n\nImplementations should build a combined covariance matrix from the given likelihood types.
