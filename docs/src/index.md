# SimulationBasedInference.jl

`SimulationBasedInference.jl` aims to bring together a variety of different methods for *simulation-based inference*, i.e. statistical inference with simulator-like models, in the Julia programming language.

Please note that this package is still very much under construction and things may break or change without prior notice.

## Introduction
Simulator-type models are ubiquitous in science and engineering.

Most simulator-type models require some kind of input, e.g boundary conditions (forcings), physical properties or constants, etc.

Often, these parameters are not fully known *a priori*... but usually we know something!

Bayesian inference provides a natural framework for constraining this uncertainty using observed data:

$$
p(\boldsymbol{\theta} | \mathbf{y}) = \frac{p(\mathbf{y}|\boldsymbol{\theta})p(\boldsymbol{\theta})}{p(\mathbf{y})}
$$

The **posterior distribution** $p(\boldsymbol{\boldsymbol{\theta}} | \mathbf{y})$ represents our **best estimate** (with uncertainty) of the unknown parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ after observing $\mathbf{y}$.

## Simulation-based inference

Simulation-based inference (SBI) [1] refers to the problem of performing **statistical inference** (Bayesian or otherwise) of unknown parameters $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ where the forward model $\mathcal{M}$:

$$
y = \mathcal{M}(\boldsymbol{\theta}) + \epsilon
$$

is a dynamical model or physics-based *simulator* mapping from parameters to noisy ($\epsilon$) observations.

There are two fundamental challenges with this problem:
1. The model $\mathcal{M}$ is almost always *non-linear* and, in the case of dynamical models, *intractable* (i.e. we cannot write down the analytical solution a priori).
2. Evaluating the forward map $\mathcal{M}(\boldsymbol{\theta})$ is usually non-trivial, i.e. **computationally expensive** or at least inconvenient.

Thus, classical statistical methods that rely on either analytical or numerical methods to derive the posterior distribution are generally difficult (or impossible) to apply.

### Methods

Although the term "simulation-based inference" is relatively new, the basic problem of statistical inference and uncertainty quantification with dynamical "simulator" models is not. In the field of geoscientific modeling in general and weather forecasting in particular, the problem is often referred to as *data assimilation* [2].

The following is a list of methods which are planned to be included in this package:

#### Ensemble/particle algorithms

  - [x] Importance sampling, a.k.a particle batch smoothing [3] (PBS) and generalized likelihood uncertainty estimation [4] (GLUE)
  - [ ] Particle Filtering/Sequential Monte Carlo [5,6] (PF/SMC)
  - [x] Ensemble Kalman sampling and inversion (EKS/EKI) via [EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/EnsembleKalmanProcesses.jl) [7]
  - [x] Ensemble smoother with multiple data assimilation [8] (ES-MDA)
  - [ ] Adaptive multiple importance sampling [9] (AMIS) 
  - [ ] Particle flow filters [10] (PFF)

#### Density estimation
  - [x] Sequential neural likelihood/posterior estimation (SNLE/SNPE) via [sbi](https://sbi-dev.github.io/sbi/)

#### Hybrid ensemble + emulator
  - [x] Calibrate, emulate, sample w/ Gaussian Processes [11] (CES-GP)

#### Markov Chain Monte Carlo
  - [ ] Affine Invariant MCMC [12] (a.k.a "emcee") via [AffineInvariantMCMC.jl](https://github.com/madsjulia/AffineInvariantMCMC.jl)
